- How to define sinks and sources?
    -sinks (branches or printf)
        -list of "protected" functions
    -sources (fscanf, argv) 
        -list of sources


- Optimizations
    - Extra pass across all functions to check for external function call
        If no, don't bother instrumenting that function.
    - Don't instrument protected functions

- Demo
    -basic3.c shows fscanf as source and can protect doStuff
