- How to define sinks and sources?
    -sinks (branches or printf)
        -list of "protected" functions
    -sources (fscanf, argv) 

- Optimizations
    - Extra pass across all functions to check for external function call
        If no, don't bother instrumenting that function.
    - don't add instruction to taint check F or F
