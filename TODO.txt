- Make sure we are calling exit() correctly.

- Add instruction to print warning message in abortBB.

- Track across function calls (how to globally store list of addresses that
  will be used to store taint values?)

- How to define sinks and sources?

- Handle values returned by reference/pointer

- Extra pass across all functions to check for external function call
    If no, don't bother instrumenting that function.
